Homework 5
================

## Problem 1

``` r
#given: no leap years (only 365 days in a yr), bdays are uniformly distributed over the year. 

#sample size of n
bday_dups = function(n) {
  
  bday = sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)  #draws bdays per person for size n
  dups = any(duplicated(bday)) #checks dups
  return(dups) #"True" means there are duplicates
}
```

``` r
simulation = 
  expand_grid(
    n = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |>
  mutate(
    estimate = map_lgl(n, bday_dups)) |>
       group_by(n) |> 
    summarize(p = mean(estimate)) #averaging across the sim runs
```

``` r
sim_plot = simulation |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = p)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Probability of Same Birthdays Across Group Size",
    x = "Group Size (n)", 
    y = "Probability") +
   scale_x_continuous(
      limits = c(0, 50),
    breaks = seq(0,50, by = 5))

sim_plot
```

The graph shows an S curve, which indicates that as group size increases
past n = 50, the curve would reach a plateau. This makes sense since
probability ranges from 0 to 1. As the group size increases, the
probability that at least 2 people will share a birthday increases
towards 1.00. Around a group size of 23, the probability is 50%.

## Problem 2

``` r
# set design elements: n=30, alpha = 5, mu = 0

sample_size = 30
sigma_std = 5

mu = 0
alpha = 0.05

#function
Q2_function = function(n, mean, sd) {
  
  dataset = rnorm(n, mean, sd)
  
  ttest = broom::tidy(t.test(dataset, mu = 0)) 
  
  return(data.frame(
    sample_mean = mean(dataset),
    p_value = ttest$p.value
  ))
}

#5000 sims and save results

# generate 5000 datasets from model x~Normal[mu, sigma]

#save mu_hat and p-value for each dataset

#Use broom::tidy to clean output of t.test()
#repeat for mu = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
```

``` r
#make plot: y = proportion of times null was rejected (power); x = true value of mu
```

The association between effect size and power as shown in the graph
above suggests thatâ€¦.

``` r
#make plot A: y = average estimate of mu_hat; x = true value of mu
#plot B: y=average estimate of mu_hat only in samples for which null was rejected; x = true value of mu 
```

Q: Is the sample average of mu hat across tests for which the null is
rejected approximlately equal to true value of mu? Why or why not?
