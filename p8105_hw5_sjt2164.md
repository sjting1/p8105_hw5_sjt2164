## Problem 1

``` r
#given: no leap years (only 365 days in a yr), bdays are uniformly distributed over the year. 

#sample size of n
bday_dups = function(n) {
  
  bday = sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)  #draws bdays per person for size n
  dups = any(duplicated(bday)) #checks dups
  return(dups) #"True" means there are duplicates
}
```

``` r
simulation = 
  expand_grid(
    n = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |>
  mutate(
    estimate = map_lgl(n, bday_dups)) |>
       group_by(n) |> 
    summarize(p = mean(estimate)) #averaging across the sim runs
```

``` r
sim_plot = simulation |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = p)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Probability of Same Birthdays Across Group Size",
    x = "Group Size (n)", 
    y = "Probability") +
   scale_x_continuous(
      limits = c(0, 50),
    breaks = seq(0,50, by = 5))

sim_plot
```

The graph shows an S curve, which indicates that as group size increases
past n = 50, the curve would reach a plateau. This makes sense since
probability ranges from 0 to 1. As the group size increases, the
probability that at least 2 people will share a birthday increases
towards 1.00. Around a group size of 23, the probability is 50%.
